# Piwigo-Ansible-Playbook
This playbook installs docker on the local device, installs docker compose, copies the docker-compose.yml code into a directory hosted on a remote server, and is supposed to deploy the media manager Piwigo, but I was unable to finish the remote side to launch Piwigo remotely.
